    - Has it changed to bullish near term
- upper and lowe resistance levels are high probable and visible
- momentum established

## Idea: Plant Longer term Directional Diagonals

### Gist

- keep looking for them based on the outlook

### Prereqs

## Idea: At the bottom end or top end, put spiked wedges
### Construction

## Idea: Leap on Micro Leap - deep in the money call/put runners
### Circumstances
- Longer term bullish reversal or direction probable
- maximum use of bulls runs
- overnight gap ups possible

### Reasoning
- occasional reverals can be covered with covered PMCC calls
- buy the dip - approach
- carve out the the occasional cyclic reversals (using oscillators Lux Algo, SMI etc), by selling calls or puts

## Idea: Butterfly, high probability zones
### Reasoning
- low loss
- there is a high probability the the prices will oscillate through the zone
### Construction
- Start with an iron butterfly, call butterfly or put butterfly
- can be lopsided (not symmetric)

## Idea: Calendar, high probability zones
### Reasoning

- there is a high probability the the prices will oscillate through the zone

## Idea: Neutralize or boost delta based on the high level direction
### Gist
- dollar cost average spread or directional plays over time
- leave enough room to place opposing delta structures to neutralize or occassionally reverse the delta 
- idea is to keep the structures for the long term so you are in the market
### Reasoning
- be in the market

### Caution
- you need to leave enough caital to be able to create opposing strategies
